                        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                        <p class="article1">
                            Mario is depicted as a portly plumber who lives in the fictional land of the Mushroom
                            Kingdom with Luigi, his younger, taller brother.[18][19][20] In the television series
                            and
                            film, Mario and Luigi are originally from Brooklyn, New York.[19] Little is known of
                            Mario's
                            childhood, though the infant version of Mario, Baby Mario, first appeared in 1995 in
                            Super
                            Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, and has often appeared in Nintendo sports games since
                            then.
                            Baby Mario has a major role along with Baby Luigi in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time and
                            appears in Yoshi's Island DS.[citation needed]

                            He wears a long-sleeved red shirt, a pair of blue overalls with yellow buttons, brown
                            shoes,
                            white gloves and a red cap with a red "M" printed on a white circle. In Donkey Kong, he
                            wore
                            a pair of red overalls, and a blue shirt. In Super Mario Bros., he wore a brown shirt
                            with
                            red overalls. He has blue eyes, and, like Luigi, has brown hair, and a dark brown or
                            black
                            mustache. This consistent difference in color is attributed to being a relic from
                            designing
                            the characters for their original platforms, wherein certain features were actively
                            distinguished while others had to be curtailed due to technical limitations.[21] In a
                            2005
                            interview, Miyamoto stated that Mario's physical age was about 24–25 years old.[22]

                            Mario's occupation is plumbing, though in the original Donkey Kong games he is a
                            carpenter.[23] Mario has also assumed several other occupations: in the Dr. Mario series
                            of
                            puzzle games, which debuted in 1990, Mario is portrayed as a medical physician named
                            "Dr.
                            Mario";[24] in the Game Boy game Mario's Picross, Mario is an archaeologist; in Mario
                            vs.
                            Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Mario is the president of a profitable toy-making
                            company.[25] Mario is an athlete in Mario sports games in games such as tennis and golf,
                            as
                            well as a kart racer in the Mario Kart series. In September 2017, Nintendo confirmed on
                            their official Japanese profile for the character that Mario was no longer considered a
                            plumber,[26] but the statement was changed in March 2018.[27]

                        <p class="article1">
                            Mario usually saves Princess Peach and the Mushroom Kingdom and purges antagonists, such
                            as
                            Bowser, from various areas; since his first game, Mario has usually had the role of
                            saving
                            the damsel in distress.[19] Originally, he had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline in
                            Donkey
                            Kong from Donkey Kong.[28] Pauline was soon replaced by Princess Peach in Super Mario
                            Bros.,[18] although Pauline has reappeared in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series and is
                            considered "Mario's friend" instead.[29] Mario reprises his role of saving Peach in the
                            Super Mario series,[19] but Mario himself was rescued by Peach in role-reversal in Super
                            Princess Peach.[30] Mario rescued Princess Daisy of Sarasaraland in Super Mario
                            Land,[31]
                            but Luigi has since been more linked to her; in Super Smash Bros. Melee, the text
                            explaining
                            Daisy states that "after her appearance in Mario Golf, gossips portrayed her as Luigi's
                            answer to Mario's Peach."[32]

                            Luigi is Mario's younger fraternal twin brother.[20] He is a companion in the Mario
                            games,[20] and the character whom the second player controls in two-player sessions of
                            many
                            of the video games.[33] Luigi has also occasionally rescued Mario as seen in Mario Is
                            Missing! and the Luigi's Mansion series.[34] Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins for the
                            Game
                            Boy saw the arrival of Wario, Mario's greedy counterpart, who sometimes assumes the role
                            of
                            Mario's antagonist or an antihero.[35] The dinosaur character Yoshi serves as Mario's
                            steed
                            in games such as Super Mario World.[36]

                        <h2>Abilities</h2>
                        <p class="article1 border-left">
                            During the development of Donkey Kong, Mario was known as 'Jumpman.'[18] Jumping—both to
                            access places and as an offensive move—is a common gameplay element in Mario games,
                            especially the Super Mario series. By the time Super Mario RPG was released, jumping
                            became
                            such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to
                            non-player characters that he was Mario. Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack
                            is
                            jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in Super Mario Bros. This
                            jump-stomp
                            move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger
                            ones, sometimes causing secondary effects.[18]

                            This attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like Koopa Troopas into or out of
                            their
                            shells, which can be used as weapons.[18] Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's
                            jumping-related abilities. Super Mario World added the ability to spin-jump, which
                            allows
                            Mario to break blocks beneath him. The Game Boy version of Donkey Kong allows Mario to
                            jump
                            higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In Super Mario 64, Mario gains
                            new
                            jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault; a ground pound, which is a high-impact
                            downward thrusting motion; and the "Wall Kick", which propels him upwards by kicking off
                            walls.

                        <h2>Concept and creation</h2>
                        <p class="article1">
                            Shigeru Miyamoto created Mario while developing Donkey Kong in an attempt to produce a
                            best-selling video game for Nintendo; previous games, such as Sheriff, had not achieved
                            the
                            success of games such as Namco's Pac-Man. Originally, Miyamoto wanted to create a game
                            that
                            used the characters Popeye, Bluto, and Olive Oyl.[18] At the time, however, as Miyamoto
                            was
                            unable to acquire a license to use the characters (and would not until 1982 with
                            Popeye), he
                            would end up creating an unnamed player character, along with Donkey Kong, and Lady
                            (later
                            known as Pauline).[18]

                            In the early stages of Donkey Kong, the focus of the game was to escape a maze, while
                            Mario
                            did not have the ability to jump. However, Miyamoto soon introduced jumping capabilities
                            for
                            the player character, reasoning that "[i]f you had a barrel rolling towards you, what
                            would
                            you do?"[46][47]
                        </p>

                    <div class="article-half">
                        <h2>Name and usage</h2>
                        <p class="article1 border-left">
                            Though the protagonist was unnamed in the Japanese release of Donkey Kong, he was named
                            "Jumpman" in the game's English instructions[48] and Mario in the sales brochure.[49]
                            Miyamoto envisioned a character to be used in every game developed by Miyamoto; a
                            "go-to"
                            character who could be placed into any game if needed, albeit in cameo appearances as
                            Miyamoto did not, at the time, expect the character to become singularly popular.[50] To
                            this end, he originally named the character "Mr. Video", comparing what he intended for
                            the
                            character's appearances in later games to the cameos that Alfred Hitchcock had done
                            within
                            his films.[51] In retrospect, Miyamoto commented that if he had named Mario "Mr. Video",
                            Mario likely would have "disappeared off the face of the Earth."[47]

                            According to a widely circulated story, during the localization of Donkey Kong for
                            American
                            audiences, Nintendo of America's warehouse landlord Mario Segale confronted
                            then-president
                            Minoru Arakawa, demanding back rent. Following a heated argument in which the Nintendo
                            employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid, they opted to name the character
                            in
                            the game Mario after him
